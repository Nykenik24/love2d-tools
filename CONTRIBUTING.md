### Contributing rules
1. Check the code before making the pull request\
> I am not a code reviewer. I will try to check the code that is merged, but errors can go trough.
2. Try to follow the steps [below](<README.md#Making modules>) when creating the module.
3. Document every method and variable and be consisent with naming conventions.
4. If you are going to make the module a class, `return` a `new()` method, not the class.
5. Comments have to be brief.
6. Make documentation descriptions short and understandable.
